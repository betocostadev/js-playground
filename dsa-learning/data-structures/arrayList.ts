// Since Arrays have a defined length
// And lists can grow and shrink, but you need to go one by one in the items in the list,
// can we do something better?
// What about Array List?
// An array list must have:
// Capacity - The size in memmory
// Length - The size with items in use
// Methods: get, len, cap, good(push, pop,).
// bad(enqueue, dequeue) - Will have to move all the items

// Try to implement yourself
